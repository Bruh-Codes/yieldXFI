# Suggested Tokenomics Improvements:

A. Yield Structure:

Consider implementing tiered staking rewards:

Longer lock periods (15+ days) → Higher APY (e.g., 12-15%)
Medium lock (7-14 days) → Base APY (10%)
Short lock (1-6 days) → Lower APY (5-8%)

B. Token Utility:

Add governance features for token holders
Implement a referral program
Create staking milestones with rewards

Risk Management:

Set maximum stake limits
Implement withdrawal cooldown periods
Add emergency withdrawal feature with penalty

Growth Strategies:

Liquidity mining programs
Partnership incentives
Community rewards

Priority Tasks:

A. Technical:

Smart contract audit
Implement slashing conditions
Add APY calculator
Improve UI/UX for position management

B. Business:

Create documentation
Develop marketing strategy
Build community engagement program
Set up monitoring systems

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or focus on a specific area?
